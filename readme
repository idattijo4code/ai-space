Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is a population-based stochastic optimization algorithm inspired by the social behaviour of bird flocks or fish schools. 
It works by iteratively improving a candidate solution (represented as a "particle") by moving it through the search space based on its own past best position 
and the best position found by the swarm. 
# How it works: 
Initialisation: A swarm of particles is randomly initialised within the search space, each with a position (representing a potential solution) and a velocity. 
Evaluation: The objective function is evaluated for each particle, determining its fitness. 
Personal Best (pBest): Each particle keeps track of its own best position encountered so far. 
Global Best (gBest): The particle with the best fitness in the entire swarm is identified as the global best. 
Velocity Update: Each particle's velocity is updated based on its current velocity, its distance from its personal best, and its distance from the global best. 
Position Update: Each particle's position is updated based on its new velocity. 
Iteration: Steps 2-6 are repeated until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a satisfactory solution is found). 
# Key concepts:
Particles: Represent potential solutions to the optimisation problem. 
Velocity: Determines how a particle moves through the search space. 
pBest: The best position a particle has encountered. 
gBest: The best position found by any particle in the swarm. 
Inertia weight: A parameter that controls the influence of the particle's previous velocity on its new velocity. 
Cognitive and social components: The velocity update equation incorporates both the particle's own experience (cognitive component) and the swarm's collective knowledge (social component). 
# Advantages of PSO:
Simplicity and ease of implementation: PSO is relatively straightforward to understand and code. 
Fast convergence in many cases: PSO can often find good solutions relatively quickly. 
No gradient information required: PSO can be used for problems where the objective function is not differentiable or its gradient is not available. 
# Limitations of PSO:
Can get stuck in local optima:
PSO might converge to a local optimum instead of the global optimum for complex, multi-modal objective functions. 
# Parameter tuning:
The performance of PSO can be sensitive to the choice of parameters (e.g., inertia weight, acceleration coefficients). 
Potential for premature convergence:
The swarm can sometimes converge too quickly, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially missing better solutions. 
# Applications:
PSO has been successfully applied to a wide range of optimization problems, including: 
Neural network training, Engineering design, Control systems, Financial modelling, and Image processing.
